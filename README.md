CS351 Database Management Systems Project

CS351 Term Project

In this project you are to design and implement a database application based on a given
database. The application is to provide a user friendly supporting interface to help the
store managers to manage their customers, the sales and the inventory. The application is
required to use the database as a backend running on a database server. The interface can
be a menu-driven interface, a graphical interface, or a web-based interface.
Before using the system, a manager must log in using their name and password. Once
logged in, the manager can perform a number of tasks which your system must support:

 Add a new author;

 Update a customer’s address information, taking the customer name as input;

 Generate a report that for each author, listing the author id, the first and last name
along with the total number of books that the author has.

 Generate a report that for each book, displays the book id, the book title, the
quantity and the total sales price, sorts by the book id in increasing order;

 Exit the system.
